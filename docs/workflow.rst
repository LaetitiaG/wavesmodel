Introducing the toolbox workflow
================================

The toolbox has a really straightforward workflow. As it is designed to be highly modulable in order to be adapted by one's specific needs, each part of this workflow is independent.

you set the simulation and experiment conditions as parameters


The modular design
------------------
 The toolbox is designed in a very modular approach to make it easy for users to build their own version that corresponds to their needs.
This can be found in:
    * the configuration read/write
    * the class design for Entry/Simulation
